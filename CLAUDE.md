# Procstudio_api Rails Development with ClaudeOnRails

This project uses ClaudeOnRails to create an intelligent swarm of AI agents specialized in different aspects of Rails development.

## Project Overview

- **Application**: Procstudio_api
- **Rails Version**: 8.0.2.1
- **Ruby Version**: 3.2.7
- **Type**: API-only
- **Test Framework**: RSpec

## How to Use

Simply describe what you want to build or fix, and the swarm will automatically coordinate the implementation:

```bash
# Start the swarm
claude-swarm orchestrate

# Then just describe your task
claude "Add user authentication with email confirmation"
claude "Optimize the dashboard queries that are running slowly"
claude "Create an API endpoint for mobile app integration"
```

## Swarm Architecture

The following specialized agents work together to implement your requests:

- **Architect**: Coordinates all development and makes high-level decisions
- **Models**: Handles ActiveRecord models, migrations, and database design
- **Controllers**: Manages request handling, routing, and controller logic
- **API**: Designs RESTful endpoints and handles serialization
- **Services**: Extracts business logic into service objects
- **Jobs**: Handles background processing and async tasks
- **Tests**: Ensures comprehensive test coverage with RSpec
- **DevOps**: Manages deployment and production configurations

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- Follow Rails conventions and best practices
- Use RuboCop for Ruby style enforcement
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Write self-documenting code

### Testing
- RSpec for all tests
- Factory Bot for test data
- Request specs for API endpoints
- System specs for user interactions

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches for new work
- Descriptive commit messages
- PR reviews before merging
- Keep main branch deployable

## Custom Patterns

Add your project-specific patterns and conventions here:

```yaml
# Example: Custom service object pattern
Services:
  Pattern: Command pattern with Result objects
  Location: app/services/
  Naming: VerbNoun (e.g., CreateOrder, SendEmail)
  Testing: Unit tests with mocked dependencies
```

## Development Tools

### AI Tools (`ai-tools/`)

#### Authenticator Tool (`authenticator.js`)
Authentication tool for API testing with predefined test users.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Authenticate a specific user
node ai-tools/authenticator.js auth user1
node ai-tools/authenticator.js auth user2

# Authenticate all test users
node ai-tools/authenticator.js auth-all

# Test API with stored token
node ai-tools/authenticator.js test user1 /api/v1/users

# List stored tokens
node ai-tools/authenticator.js list

# Clear all tokens
node ai-tools/authenticator.js clear

# Show help
node ai-tools/authenticator.js help
```

**Test Users:**
- `user1`: u1@gmail.com / 123456
- `user2`: u2@gmail.com / 123456

**Features:**
- Persistent token storage in `.auth-token.json`
- Automatic token extraction from API responses
- Built-in API testing capabilities
- User-friendly CLI interface

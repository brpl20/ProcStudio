Implementation Summary:

1. Enhanced Profile Completion Modal (ProfileCompletionEnhanced.svelte)
   Created a new enhanced modal that intelligently detects and handles missing data:

Key Features:

Detects when critical fields are missing (name, last_name, role, address, OAB)
Shows warning message: "Alguns dados não foram preenchidos automaticamente. Por favor, complete as informações manualmente."
Dynamically displays only the missing fields:
Name and Last Name - when not fetched from API
Role dropdown - with options: Advogado(a), Secretário(a), Estagiário(a), Paralegal, Contador(a)
OAB field - shown for lawyers when OAB is missing (with format hint: "PR123456 ou 123456")
Full Address section - CEP, street, number, neighborhood, city, state (using Brazilian states constants)
Standard fields: CPF, RG, gender, civil status, nationality, birth date, phone
Smart Validations:

OAB is required only for lawyers
Phone formatting: (XX) XXXXX-XXXX
ZIP code formatting: XXXXX-XXX
CPF validation
Birth date validation 2. Backend Support (UserProfilesController)
Updated the complete_profile action with full nested attributes support:

Accepted Parameters:

[:name, :last_name, :role, :oab, :cpf, :rg, :gender, :civil_status,
:nationality, :birth, :phone,
{ addresses_attributes: [:description, :zip_code, :street, :number,
:neighborhood, :city, :state],
phones_attributes: [:phone_number] }]

ruby

Features:

Creates UserAddress associations when address data is provided
Handles both legacy phone field and nested phones_attributes
Transaction-safe updates 3. Frontend Integration (App.svelte)
Replaced ProfileCompletion with ProfileCompletionEnhanced
Seamless integration with existing auth flow
How the Fallback Works:
Scenario 1: API Works Fully
User sees only missing personal fields (CPF, RG, birth date, etc.)
Name, OAB, and profession are pre-filled from API
Scenario 2: API Partially Works
Pre-fills available data (e.g., OAB might be present but name missing)
Shows input fields only for missing information
Warning message alerts user about manual completion
Scenario 3: API Fails Completely
All fields are shown for manual entry
Title changes to "Complete seu Cadastro"
User can manually enter:
Name and Last Name
Role/Profession
OAB (for lawyers)
Complete address
All other required fields
Testing Guide:
Trigger the fallback by simulating API failures or incomplete data
Verify the modal shows:
Missing fields detection works correctly
OAB field appears for lawyers
Address fields are properly formatted
Validation prevents submission with incomplete data
Check data submission:
All fields are sent as nested attributes
Address is saved in the addresses table
Phone is saved in the phones table
UserProfile is properly updated
The solution ensures users can always complete their onboarding regardless of the OAB API status, preventing the blocking error "Campos obrigatórios não preenchidos: name, last_name, role, address" and providing a smooth fallback experience.

# Admin Route Fix - October 9, 2025

## Problem
`/admin` route was redirecting to `/login` even when authenticated.

## Root Cause
Route was protected with RoleGuard requiring "admin" or "super_admin" roles, but the system only has "lawyer" role (no role separation yet).

## Fix Applied

### routerStore.ts - Removed Role Requirement
**Before:**
```typescript
this.routes.set('/admin', {
  path: '/admin',
  guards: [
    guards.combine(
      guards.auth(),
      guards.roles('admin', 'super_admin')
    )
  ],
  meta: { requiresAuth: true, roles: ['admin', 'super_admin'] }
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
this.routes.set('/admin', {
  path: '/admin',
  guards: [guards.auth()],
  meta: { requiresAuth: true }
});
```

### guards.ts - Fixed Role Check (for future use)
Also fixed RoleGuard to check `role` (singular) instead of `roles` (plural):
```typescript
const userRole = authStore.user.data?.role;
return this.requiredRoles.includes(userRole);
```

## Current System Architecture
- All users have role: `"lawyer"` in UserProfile
- No role separation/authorization yet
- `/admin` page accessible to all authenticated users
- When role separation is needed, RoleGuard is ready to use

## How to Test
1. Login with any user (role: "lawyer")
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/admin
3. Should work ✅

## Build Status
✅ Build successful

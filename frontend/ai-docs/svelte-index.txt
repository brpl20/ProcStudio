# Svelte Documentation for LLMs

> Svelte is a UI framework that uses a compiler to let you write breathtakingly concise components that do minimal work in the browser, using languages you already know â€” HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Documentation Sets

- [Abridged documentation](svelte-medium.txt): A shorter version of the Svelte and SvelteKit documentation, with examples and non-essential content removed
- [Compressed documentation](svelte-small.txt): A minimal version of the Svelte and SvelteKit documentation, with many examples and non-essential content removed
- [Complete documentation](svelte-full.txt): The complete Svelte and SvelteKit documentation including all examples and additional content

## Notes

- The abridged and compressed documentation excludes legacy compatibility notes, detailed examples, and supplementary information

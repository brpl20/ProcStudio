  ðŸ“§ Email Background Jobs Setup Complete!

  What was done:

  1. Active Job Configuration:
    - Set up async adapter for development (runs jobs in thread pool)
    - Created MailDeliveryJob to handle email deliveries
  2. Sidekiq Setup (for production):
    - Added Sidekiq and Redis gems
    - Created config/sidekiq.yml with queue priorities
    - Added Sidekiq initializer
    - Mounted Sidekiq Web UI at /sidekiq (development only)
  3. Updated Mailers:
    - Modified Devise mailer to use MailDeliveryJob.perform_later
    - Emails now queue as background jobs instead of blocking requests

  How to use it:

  For Development (Simple - no extra setup):
  # Just restart your Rails server
  bundle install
  rails server
  The async adapter will handle jobs automatically in-process.

  For Production with Sidekiq (Optional):
  # Install Redis first (if not installed)
  brew install redis  # macOS
  redis-server        # Start Redis

  # Then run Sidekiq
  bundle exec sidekiq

  Benefits:

  - âœ… Non-blocking: Customer creation won't wait for email sending
  - âœ… Retry logic: Failed emails retry automatically (3 attempts)
  - âœ… Better performance: API responds faster
  - âœ… Scalable: Ready for Sidekiq in production
  - âœ… Monitoring: Sidekiq Web UI at http://localhost:3000/sidekiq

  Current Configuration:

  - Development: Uses async adapter (no Redis needed)
  - Production/Staging: Ready for Sidekiq (just needs Redis)
  - Emails disabled: Still disabled in development per your config

  The system is now properly configured for background job processing! Your API will respond much faster since email sending happens asynchronously.

‚è∫ Complex metrics violations are crucial indicators of code quality and maintainability issues. Let me explain what each metric means and why they matter:

  The Key Metrics

  1. ABC Size (Assignment, Branch, Condition)

  - What it measures: Complexity based on Assignments, Branches (method calls), and Conditionals
  - Impact: Methods with high ABC scores are doing too much - they're hard to understand, test, and debug
  - Example from your code: assign_users_to_job has ABC of 53.09 (limit is 20)

  2. Cyclomatic Complexity

  - What it measures: Number of independent paths through code (if/else, loops, case statements)
  - Impact: Higher complexity = more test cases needed, harder to reason about all scenarios
  - Example: Your check_profile_completeness has 14 paths (limit is 10)

  3. Method Length

  - What it measures: Lines of code in a method
  - Impact: Long methods are harder to understand at a glance, often violate Single Responsibility Principle
  - Example: Several methods exceed 20 lines (some have 44 lines)

  4. Class Length

  - What it measures: Total lines in a class
  - Impact: Large classes often have too many responsibilities, become "God objects"
  - Example: JobsController has 217 lines (limit is 200)

  Real-World Consequences

  Maintainability Issues:

  - Cognitive Load: Developers need to hold too much context in their heads
  - Bug-Prone: More complexity = more places for bugs to hide
  - Testing Nightmare: High cyclomatic complexity means exponentially more test scenarios
  - Refactoring Risk: Complex methods are scary to change - "if it works, don't touch it"

  Team Impact:

  - Onboarding: New developers struggle to understand complex code
  - Code Reviews: Harder to review changes in complex methods
  - Debugging Time: Finding issues takes longer in tangled code
  - Technical Debt: Accumulates faster as developers avoid touching complex areas

  Solutions

  For High ABC Size:

  # Before (high ABC)
  def assign_users_to_job(job, job_params, update: false)
    # 44 lines of tangled logic...
  end

  # After (refactored)
  def assign_users_to_job(job, job_params, update: false)
    assignment_strategy = determine_assignment_strategy(job_params)
    existing_assignments = job.job_user_profiles if update

    assignment_strategy.execute(job, existing_assignments)
  end

  For High Cyclomatic Complexity:

  # Before (14 branches)
  def check_profile_completeness(user_profile)
    if !user_profile.name? || !user_profile.email? || ...
      # nested conditions...
    end
  end

  # After (using early returns and extraction)
  def check_profile_completeness(user_profile)
    return incomplete_profile_error unless basic_info_complete?(user_profile)
    return missing_documents_error unless documents_complete?(user_profile)
    return missing_address_error unless address_complete?(user_profile)

    { complete: true }
  end

  For Long Methods:

  Extract cohesive chunks into private methods with descriptive names. Each method should do ONE thing well.

  Why Fix These Now?

  1. Compound Interest: Complex code attracts more complexity
  2. Bug Multiplication: Bugs in complex code are harder to find and fix
  3. Team Velocity: Simple code = faster feature development
  4. Mental Health: Developers are happier working with clean code

  The RuboCop todo file lets you track these issues, but they should be prioritized for refactoring soon. Would you like me to help refactor some of the most critical violations?

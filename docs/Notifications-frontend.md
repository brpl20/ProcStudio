# Frontend Notification System Implementation Plan

1. Architecture Overview

- Real-time Updates: WebSocket connection via Action Cable
- Fallback: REST API polling for offline/disconnected states
- State Management: Svelte stores for reactive notification state
- Persistence: LocalStorage for read/unread state sync

2. WebSocket Setup

- Connection Manager:
  - Establish Action Cable connection on app initialization
  - Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
  - Authentication via JWT token in connection params
- Subscription Channels:
  - NotificationChannel for real-time updates
  - Handle connection lifecycle events

3. Component Structure

components/
├── NotificationBell.svelte        # Header icon with unread count
├── NotificationDropdown.svelte    # Quick view dropdown
├── NotificationList.svelte        # Full notification list
├── NotificationItem.svelte        # Individual notification
├── NotificationToast.svelte       # Pop-up for new notifications
└── NotificationCenter.svelte      # Full-page notification center

4. State Management

- Svelte Stores:
  - notificationStore - Array of notifications
  - unreadCount - Derived store for badge
  - connectionStatus - WebSocket connection state
  - filters - Active filter preferences
- Actions:
  - Add/remove notifications
  - Mark as read/unread
  - Bulk operations
  - Filter/sort notifications

5. UI/UX Features

- Visual Indicators:
  - Badge with unread count
  - Priority-based color coding
  - Animation for new notifications
- Interactions:
  - Click to mark as read
  - Swipe to dismiss (mobile)
  - Bulk select and actions
  - Filter by type/priority/date
- Toast Notifications:
  - Show for high-priority items
  - Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
  - Click to navigate to action

6. Job Creation Integration

- Backend Trigger:
  - Add after_create callback in Job model
  - Create notification with job details
  - Broadcast via NotificationChannel
- Frontend Handling:
  - Receive job notification via WebSocket
  - Display toast for new job
  - Update notification list
  - Navigate to job details on click

7. Performance Optimizations

- Pagination: Load notifications in chunks
- Virtual Scrolling: For large lists
- Debounced Updates: Batch multiple notifications
- Lazy Loading: Load details on demand
- Cache Strategy: Store recent notifications locally

8. Error Handling

- Connection Failures: Queue notifications locally
- Retry Logic: Exponential backoff for failed requests
- Offline Mode: Show cached notifications
- Sync on Reconnect: Reconcile local/server state

9. Testing Strategy

- Unit Tests: Store logic and utilities
- Component Tests: UI interactions
- E2E Tests: Full notification flow
- WebSocket Mocking: For reliable testing

10. Implementation Phases

1. Phase 1: Basic notification display and REST API
2. Phase 2: WebSocket integration
3. Phase 3: Job creation notifications
4. Phase 4: Advanced features (filters, bulk actions)
5. Phase 5: Performance optimizations

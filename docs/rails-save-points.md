Algumas vezes voce pode se deparar com um comportamento do Rails que é o Savepoints, parece que tem algo errado mas é simplesmente o sistema criando camada de proteção para salvamento, isso acontece quando temos modelos interelacionados.


⏺ Analysis

  The savepoint behavior you're seeing is normal and expected in Rails. Here's what's happening:

  Current Behavior (app/models/office.rb:388-389)

  1. Line 388: Email.find_or_create_by(email: email_value) creates a savepoint when it needs to create a new
  Email record
  2. Line 389: office_emails.find_or_create_by(email: email) creates another savepoint when creating a new
  OfficeEmail record

  Why Savepoints Are Created

  Rails uses savepoints automatically when:
  - You're already inside a transaction (from the parent create/update operation)
  - You perform nested database operations that might fail
  - Using find_or_create_by which internally uses transactions for atomicity

  This is Rails' way of ensuring data integrity - if the nested operation fails, it can rollback just that
  operation without affecting the entire parent transaction.

  Optimization Options

  If you want to reduce savepoints (though the current behavior is safe):

⏺ Write(app/models/office_optimized_example.rb)
  ⎿  Wrote 63 lines to app/models/office_optimized_example.rb
     # Option 1: Batch operations to reduce savepoints
     def process_pending_emails_optimized
       return if @pending_emails.blank?
       attrs_array = @pending_emails.is_a?(Array) ? @pending_emails : @pending_emails.values
       # Collect all email values first
       email_values = attrs_array.filter_map do |attrs|
         attrs = attrs.with_indifferent_access if attrs.respond_to?(:with_indifferent_access)
         next if attrs['_destroy'] == '1'

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Examine the process_pending_emails method in office.rb
     ☒ Analyze the savepoint behavior and determine if it's expected
     ☒ Provide recommendations if any fix is needed

⏺ Verdict

  The savepoint behavior is regular and expected - it's Rails ensuring data integrity during nested database
  operations within a transaction. No fix is required.

  The savepoints are created because:
  1. The process_pending_emails runs within the parent office create/update transaction
  2. find_or_create_by operations need their own sub-transactions for atomicity
  3. Rails uses savepoints to allow partial rollbacks if needed

  If you want to optimize for performance (though current behavior is perfectly fine), I've created
  office_optimized_example.rb showing two approaches:
  - Option 1: Batch operations with insert_all (fewer database round trips)
  - Option 2: Disable nested transactions with requires_new: false

  The current implementation is safe and follows Rails best practices. Only consider optimization if you're
  processing hundreds of emails at once.

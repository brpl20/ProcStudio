# Office Rethinking B

● Let me think through the best placement for these two important pieces of information:

  1. Participation Percentage (Ownership Stake)

  This should go in the LawyerSociety join model as a new column like participation_percentage:

  Reasoning:
  - The participation % is relationship-specific (lawyer A might have 30% in Society X but 50% in Society Y)
  - It's a property of the partnership itself, not inherent to either the lawyer or society alone
  - The join table already tracks partnership-specific data like partnership_type
  - You'll want validations ensuring all participations in a society sum to 100%

  Implementation suggestion:
  # In LawyerSociety model
  # Add: participation_percentage (decimal, precision: 5, scale: 2)
  validates :participation_percentage,
    presence: true,
    numericality: { greater_than: 0, less_than_or_equal_to: 100 }

  # Custom validation in Society model
  validate :participation_percentages_sum_to_100

  2. Tax Regime/Accountability Type

  This should go in the Society model as a new column like tax_regime:

  Reasoning:
  - It's a property of the society as a legal entity
  - All lawyers in the society share the same tax structure
  - It affects how the society operates and reports taxes overall
  - Brazilian tax regimes (Simples Nacional, Ltda, Sociedade Unipessoal) apply to the company, not individual partnerships

  Implementation suggestion:
  # In Society model
  enum :tax_regime, {
    simples_nacional: 'simples_nacional',
    limitada: 'limitada',
    sociedade_unipessoal: 'sociedade_unipessoal'
  }

  This structure maintains proper normalization and allows for accurate business logic validations specific to Brazilian legal requirements.

> ok, how do I select an Socio Administrador? The one that has more reponsabilities? Can be one, two, or all the lawyers... Also pro labore (the montly money for participating) or when a Socio de Servico 
  receiveis his montly wage > ?

● Let me think through these administrative and financial aspects:

  1. Sócio Administrador (Managing Partner)

  This should be tracked in the LawyerSociety join model as a boolean flag:

  Reasoning:
  - Multiple lawyers can be administrators in the same society
  - It's role-specific to that partnership (Lawyer A might be admin in Society X but not in Society Y)
  - Tracks additional legal responsibilities within that specific society

  Implementation suggestion:
  # In LawyerSociety model
  # Add: is_administrator (boolean, default: false)
  # Add: administrator_since (date, optional)

  scope :administrators, -> { where(is_administrator: true) }

  # In Society model
  def administrators
    lawyers.joins(:lawyer_societies).where(lawyer_societies: { is_administrator: true })
  end

  2. Financial Compensation Structure

  Create a new model LawyerSocietyCompensation linked to LawyerSociety:

  Reasoning:
  - Compensation can change over time (needs history tracking)
  - Different types: pro labore (managing partners), salary (Sócio de Serviço), profit distribution
  - May need monthly/quarterly records for accounting
  - Brazilian labor/tax laws require detailed records

  Implementation suggestion:
  # New model: LawyerSocietyCompensation
  class LawyerSocietyCompensation < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :lawyer_society

    enum :compensation_type, {
      pro_labore: 'pro_labore',           # For administrators
      salary: 'salary',                    # For Sócio de Serviço
      profit_distribution: 'profit_distribution'  # Based on participation %
    }

    # Fields:
    # - amount (decimal)
    # - compensation_type (enum)
    # - effective_date (date)
    # - end_date (date, nullable)
    # - payment_frequency (monthly, quarterly, etc.)
    # - notes (text)
  end

  # In LawyerSociety model
  has_many :compensations, class_name: 'LawyerSocietyCompensation'

  def current_pro_labore
    compensations.pro_labore.where(end_date: nil).last&.amount if is_administrator
  end

  def current_salary
    compensations.salary.where(end_date: nil).last&.amount if partnership_type == 'socio_de_servico'
  end

  This structure allows you to:
  - Track multiple administrators per society
  - Maintain compensation history for tax/legal compliance
  - Handle different compensation types based on partner role
  - Generate reports for Brazilian tax authorities (eSocial, IRPF, etc.)
